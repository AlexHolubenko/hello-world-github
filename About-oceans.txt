Oceans cover 71% of the Earth's surface. The different oceans merge into one another, forming the largest habitat on earth.
The 3 major oceans of the world are the Pacific, the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. 
The Arctic Ocean surrounds the North Pole while the Southern Ocean (really the southern portion of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans) surrounds the continent of Antarctica.
Great ocean currents swirl around the Earth, many of them thousands of kilometres long. Some are warm currents, some are cold. 
These currents have an enormous effect on the world's weather systems. Oceans also have layers of water at different temperatures.
